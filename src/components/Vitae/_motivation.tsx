        Hi, I'm looking for a trainee or junior front-end position in an IT
        company. I don't have any commercial experience front-end but I will do
        my best to get a chance to realize myself. Previously I worked at a
        brewery and made beer. I made a lot of effort to self-study, and keep
        going. I am fast in learning and responsible, passed a few courses on
        udemy and YouTube, and watched many different tutorials.
      </p>
